This is Timely
==============

*This is Timely* is a minimalist kitchen timer, which can be found at [thisistimely.com](http://thisistimely.com/).

It's a very simple project that I made for myself. The idea is to provide an easy to use, attractive timer that doesn't use Flash.

I'd like to add more features in the near future, when I have time:

* different background colors for each timer opened in a tab (automatically chosen for the user) 
* a brief description of what the timer is for, useful for multiple timers
* tests (how embarrassing)
* push notifications sent to your phone (useful if you're in another room)

There are some known bugs:

* timer doesn't always play a sound in Chrome if the tab isn't focused
