    %h2 What is this?
    %p
      %strong this is timely
      is a minimal kitchen timer, inspired by the venerable
      %a{ :href=> "http://e.ggtimer.com" } e.ggtimer.com.
      It uses JavaScript instead of Flash and plays nicely with Apple products.

    %h2 Why?
    %p
      I made this because my Macbook Pro goes nuts when websites using Flash are left open for more than a few minutes. It was also a fun excuse to make a minimal site and play around with
      %a{ :href => "http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" } responsive design.

    %h2 Does this work on iPhone / iPad?
    %p
      Oh indeed. It's optimized for desktop but also works well on mobile devices and tablets, especially if you bookmark your timers.
